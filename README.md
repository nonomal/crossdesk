# Intro

CrossDesk is a lightweight cross-platform remote desktop software.

CrossDesk is an experimental application of [MiniRTC](https://github.com/kunkundi/minirtc.git), a lightweight cross-platform real-time audio and video transmission library. MiniRTC provides fundamental capabilities including network traversal ([RFC5245](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5245)), video software/hardware encoding and decoding (H264/AV1), audio encoding/decoding ([Opus](https://github.com/xiph/opus)), signaling interaction, network congestion control ([TCP over UDP](https://libnice.freedesktop.org/)), and transmission encryption ([SRTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3711)).

## Usage

Enter the remote desktop ID in the menu bar’s “Remote ID” field and click “→” to initiate a remote connection.

If the remote desktop requires a connection password, you must enter the correct password on your side to successfully establish the connection.

Before connecting, you can customize configuration options in the settings, such as language and video encoding format.
